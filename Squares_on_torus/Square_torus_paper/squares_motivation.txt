What is the effect of an external potential on packings of hard objects? One example of an external potential is fixed boundary conditions.  Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the densest packings of squares and circles various domains.  Another example with more physical applications is an external periodic potential. If this potential is strong enough, the packing of the hard objects will be forced to be adopt the periodicity of the potential and new packings are expected to arise.  The limiting case of an imposed periodic potential is periodic boundary conditions.  In this paper we explore the configurations of hard squares in periodic boundary conditions.  Our results may have experimental relevance for hard square colloidal particles in a periodic potential imposed either by a substrate or an optical lattice.
