1) We have added a paragraph to the introduction, situating our results in experimental physics, and included an additional reference (# 20, Frenkel).
2) We have added in a "-k" to the relevant equation
3) We have changed the relevant subsection title to "lattic packings with vacancies"
4) We have changed the relevant sentence to read: "Next we consider Bravais lattice solutions that have density less than one -- that is, packings with gap $d-1 > 0$."
5) We have added R.L. Graham as second author in the relevant reference.

Re: Question (Q1)

The simplest way to produce candidates for a densest packing for $N=n_2^2 + n_4^2-k$ is to remove $k$ squares from a density-one packing; indeed, our numerical results suggest that for several values of $N$, the densest packing is a density-one packing with one missing square.  This is indicated in the Comment column in the Table using the notation $n_1^2-1$ or $n_1^2+ n_2^2-1$, depending on whether they are generated by removing $1$ square from $N$ a square integer, or a sum of two square integers respectively.  As is demonstrated in Fig. \ref{fig:n4} for the case of $N=2^2+2^2-1=7$, such vacancies allow for continuous displacement of other squares within a row, leading to a finite entropy for such configurations.  Other examples include $N=3$ and $15$.
