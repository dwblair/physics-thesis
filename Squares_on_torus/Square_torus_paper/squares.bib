abstract = {Dense packings composed of irregular polyhedral particles are investigated by numerical simulations under quasistatic triaxial compression. The Contact Dynamics method is used for this investigation with 40 000 particles. The effect of particle shape is analyzed by comparing this packing with a packing of similar particle size distribution but with spherical particles. We analyze the origin of the higher shear strength of the polyhedra packing by considering various anisotropy parameters characterizing the microstructure and force transmission. Remarkably, we find that the polyhedra packing has a lower fabric anisotropy in terms of branch vectors (joining the particle centers) than the sphere packing. In contrast, the polyhedra packing shows a much higher force anisotropy which is at the origin of its higher shear strength. The force anisotropy in the polyhedra packing is shown to be related to the formation of face-face contacts. In particular, most face-face contacts belong to strong force chains along the major principal stress direction whereas vertex-face and edge-edge contacts are correlated with weak forces and oriented on average along the minor principal stress direction in steady shearing.},

abstract = {Motivated by the relation between particle shape and packing, we measure the volume fraction $\phi$ occupied by the Platonic solids which are a class of polyhedrons with congruent sides, vertices, and dihedral angles. Tetrahedron-, cube-, octahedron-, dodecahedron-, and icosahedron-shaped plastic dice were fluidized or mechanically vibrated to find stable random loose packing $\phi$rlp=0.51,0.54,0.52,0.51,0.50 and densest packing $\phi$rcp=0.64,0.67,0.64,0.63,0.59, respectively, with standard deviation of ≃ ± 0.01. We find that $\phi$ obtained by all protocols peak at the cube, which is the only Platonic solid that can tessellate space, and then monotonically decrease with number of sides. This overall trend is similar but systematically lower than the maximum $\phi$ reported for frictionless Platonic solids and below $\phi$rlp of spheres for the loose packings. Experiments with ceramic tetrahedron were also conducted, and higher friction was observed to lead to lower $\phi$.},

abstract = {During the years 1903-1914, Ramanujan worked in almost complete isolation in India. During this time, he recorded most of his mathematical discoveries without proofs in notebooks. Although many of his results were already found in the literature, most were not. Almost a decade after Ramanujan's death in 1920, G.N. Watson and B.M. Wilson began to edit Ramanujan's notebooks, but they never completed the task. A photostat edition, with no editing, was published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay in 1957. This book is the fourth of five volumes devoted to the editing of Ramanujan's notebooks. Parts I, II, and III, published in 1985, 1989, and 1991, contain accounts of Chapters 1-21 in Ramanujan's second notebook as well as a description of his quarterly reports. This is the first of two volumes devoted to proving the results found in the unorganized portions of the second notebook and in the third notebook. The author also proves those results in the first notebook that are not found in the second or third notebooks. For those results that are known, references in the literature are provided. Otherwise, complete proofs are given. Over 1/2 of the results in the notebooks are new. Many of them are so startling and different that there are no results akin to them in the literature.},

A packing is a maximum family of pairwise disjoint squares. The one-dimensional version of the problem is the classical random interval packing problem. This paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of packings as n tends towards infinity while d = 2. Coffman et al. recently proved that the average size of packing is (n d=(d+1) ). Using partitioning techniques, sub-additivity and concentration of measure arguments, we show first that, after normalization by n 2=3 , the size of two-dimensional square packings tends in probability towards a genuine limit . Straightforward concentration arguments show that large fluctuations of order n 2=3 should have probability vanishing exponentially fast with n 2=3 .

Assuming a familiarity with the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, the book establishes a general framework for describing condensed phases of matter based on symmetries and conservation laws. After surveying the structure and properties of materials with different symmetries, it explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions. Particular attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods. The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids, magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of their symmetry, generalized rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect structure. In addition to serving as a course text, this book is an essential reference for students and researchers in physics, applied physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, who are interested in modern condensed matter physics.},

abstract = {Packing problems, such as how densely objects can fill a volume, are among the most ancient and persistent problems in mathematics and science. For equal spheres, it has only recently been proved that the face-centered cubic lattice has the highest possible packing fraction phi=pi/18 approximately 0.74. It is also well known that certain random (amorphous) jammed packings have phi approximately 0.64. Here, we show experimentally and with a new simulation algorithm that ellipsoids can randomly pack more densely-up to phi= 0.68 to 0.71 for spheroids with an aspect ratio close to that of M\&M's Candies-and even approach phi approximately 0.74 for ellipsoids with other aspect ratios. We suggest that the higher density is directly related to the higher number of degrees of freedom per particle and thus the larger number of particle contacts required to mechanically stabilize the packing. We measured the number of contacts per particle Z approximately 10 for our spheroids, as compared to Z approximately 6 for spheres. Our results have implications for a broad range of scientific disciplines, including the properties of granular media and ceramics, glass formation, and discrete geometry.},

 imaged and the particle coordinates were retrieved using particle tracking routines. To distinguish
 different types of disorder present in the crystals the corresponding diffraction patterns were
 computed from the real-space coordinates. We show that second-type disorder is present in the
 crystals of both the spheres and the polyhedrals. The amount of second-type disorder is
 significantly larger in the crystal of the polyhedrals. This shows that colloidal crystals form an
 ideal model system to study various types of disorder since the analysis is possible in both real
 and reciprocal space. Simulating diffraction patterns from real-space coordinates therefore provides
 a useful route to a better understanding and interpretation of diffraction patterns.},

Of course, if $\alpha$ is a positive integer, it is trivial to see that $\alpha$2 unit squares can be succesfully packed. However, if $\alpha$ is not an integer, the problem becomes much more complicated. Intuitively, one feels that for , say (where N is an integer), one should pack N2 unit squares in the obvious way and surrender the uncovered border area (which is about ) as unusable waste. After all, how could it help to place the unit squares at all sorts of various skew angles? In this note, we show how it helps. In particular, we prove that we can always keep the amount of uncovered area down to at most proportional to , which for large $\alpha$ is much less than the linear waste produced by the “natural” packing above.},

abstract = {We propose a novel biologically constrained three-phase model of the brain microstructure. Designing a realistic model is tantamount to a packing problem, and for this reason, a number of techniques from the theory of random heterogeneous materials can be brought to bear on this problem. Our analysis strongly suggests that previously developed two-phase models in which cells are packed in the extracellular space are insufficient representations of the brain microstructure. These models either do not preserve realistic geometric and topological features of brain tissue or preserve these properties while overestimating the brain's effective diffusivity, an average measure of the underlying microstructure. In light of the highly connected nature of three-dimensional space, which limits the minimum diffusivity of biologically constrained two-phase models, we explore the previously proposed hypothesis that the extracellular matrix is an important factor that contributes to the diffusivity of brain tissue. Using accurate first-passage-time techniques, we support this hypothesis by showing that the incorporation of the extracellular matrix as the third phase of a biologically constrained model gives the reduction in the diffusion coefficient necessary for the three-phase model to be a valid representation of the brain microstructure.},

@article{Jansson2006,
abstract = {We report a novel and spectacular instability of a fluid surface in a rotating system. In a flow driven by rotating the bottom plate of a partially filled, stationary cylindrical container, the shape of the free surface can spontaneously break the axial symmetry and assume the form of a polygon rotating rigidly with a speed different from that of the plate. With water, we have observed polygons with up to 6 corners. It has been known for many years that such flows are prone to symmetry breaking, but apparently the polygonal surface shapes have never been observed. The creation of rotating internal waves in a similar setup was observed for much lower rotation rates, where the free surface remains essentially flat J. M. Lopez, J. Fluid Mech. 502, 99 (2004). We speculate that the instability is caused by the strong azimuthal shear due to the stationary walls and that it is triggered by minute wobbling of the rotating plate.},

abstract = {The average packing density inside proteins is as high as in crystalline solids. Does this mean proteins are well-packed? We go beyond average densities, and look at the full distribution functions of free volumes inside proteins. Using a new and rigorous Delaunay triangulation method for parsing space into empty and filled regions, we introduce formal definitions of interior and surface packing densities. Although proteins look like organic crystals by the criterion of average density, they look more like liquids and glasses by the criterion of their free volume distributions. The distributions are broad, and the scalings of volume-to-surface, volume-to-cluster-radius, and numbers of void versus volume show that the interiors of proteins are more like randomly packed spheres near their percolation threshold than like jigsaw puzzles. We find that larger proteins are packed more loosely than smaller proteins. And we find that the enthalpies of folding (per amino acid) are independent of the packing density of a protein, indicating that van der Waals interactions are not a dominant component of the folding forces.},

Population annealing combines simulated annealing and Boltzmann weighted differential reproduction within a population of replicas to sample equilibrium states. Population annealing gives direct access to the free energy. It is shown that unbiased measurements of observables can be obtained by weighted averages over many runs with weight factors related to the free-energy estimate from the run. Population annealing is well suited to parallelization and may be a useful alternative to parallel tempering for systems with rough free-energy landscapes such as spin glasses. The method is demonstrated for spin glasses.},

The idea behind the proposal is expanding volume instead of increasing temperature to let crowded systems characterized by dominant repulsive interactions to unblock, and so, to produce sampling from disjoint configurations. The method produces, in a single parallel run, the complete HS equation of state. Thus, the first order fluid-solid transition is captured. The obtained results well agree with previous calculations. This approach seems particularly useful to treat purely entropy-driven systems such as hard body and nonadditive hard mixtures, where temperature plays a trivial role.},

abstract = {A new generation of single-molecule experiments has opened up the possibility of reexamining many of the fundamental processes of biochemistry and molecular biology from a unique and quantitative perspective. One technique producing a host of intriguing results is the use of optical tweezers to measure the mechanical forces exerted by molecular motors during key processes such as the transcription of DNA or the packing of a viral genome into its capsid. The objective of the current article is to respond to such measurements on viruses and to use the theory of elasticity and a simple model of charge and hydration forces to derive the force required to pack DNA into a viral capsid as a function of the fraction of the viral genome that has been packed. The results are found to be in excellent accord with recent measurements and complement previous theoretical work. Because the packing of DNA in viral capsids occurs under circumstances of high internal pressure, we also compute how much pressure a capsid can sustain without rupture.},
