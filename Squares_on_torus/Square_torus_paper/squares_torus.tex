\begin{abstract}
The densest packings of $N$ unit squares in a torus are studied using analytical methods as well as simulated annealing.  A rich array of dense packing solutions are found: density one packings when $N$ is the sum of two square integers; a family of ``gapped bricklayer'' Bravais lattice
 solutions with density $N/(N+1)$; and some surprising non-Bravais lattice configurations, including lattices of holes as well as a configuration for $N=23$ in which not all squares share the same orientation.  The entropy of some of these configurations and the frequency and orientation of density one solutions as $N \rightarrow \infty$ are discussed.
