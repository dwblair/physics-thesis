\section{Introduction}

Understanding the dense packings of hard particles has yielded essential insights into the structure of materials \cite{Bernal2007} \cite{Zallen1983} \cite{Torquato2002} \cite{Chaikin2000}, granular media \cite{Torquato2002} \cite{Mehta1994}, number theory \cite{Cohn2008} \cite{Conway1999}, biology \cite{Liang2001} \cite{Gevertz2008} \cite{Purohit2003}, and computer science \cite{Johnson1974} \cite{Lodi2002}. This understanding has been hard won -- millennia can elapse between a conjecture and its proof. This is best exemplified by sphere packing, for which a proof had not been found until 1998 \cite{Hales2011}.

Recent experimental advances have allowed the development of (nearly) hard colloids that, for entropic reasons, manifest the densest sphere packing []. Obtaining a similarly deep understanding of liquid crystal mesophases suggests the study of the dense packing of anisotropic particles. This has led to the recent study of the packing of ellipsoids [], polyhedra [], and polygons [].

One of the simplest regular polygons one can pack in two dimensions is the square. On the plane, the densest packing is trivial -- a square lattice of squares. Monte Carlo simulations of squares, however, have also found a tetratic phase \cite{Donev2006b}, and experiments with hard colloidal squares has found, rather than the tetratic phase, a rhombic crystal having a different symmetry than the square \cite{Zhao2011}. Even the dense packing of a finite number of squares can be more complicated than naive considerations would indicate -- in fact, this problem has been shown \cite{Leung1990} to be NP-Hard \cite{Garey1979}. The densest known packings of squares inside a larger square are quite complex \cite{ERDOS1975} \cite{Friedman2002} when the number of squares is not a perfect square. Higher packing densities than that of a simple square lattice with defects can be achieved through configurations in which some of the squares are rotated and shifted with respect to the simple square lattice \cite{Friedman2002}.

In this paper, we study an even simpler packing problem -- finding the densest packings of squares in a torus: that is, a larger square with periodic boundary conditions. Even with the additional translation symmetry afforded by packing the squares in a torus, the resulting dense packings can still be far from simple. As with many other mathematical packing problems, the strategy here is to search for the smallest area torus that can accommodate a fixed number of squares $N$. 
For $N$ up to 27, we develop lower bounds on the packing density. 
In particular, there is a packing with density one whenever $N$ is a sum of two square integers. In other cases, we use Monte Carlo simulations with a simulated annealing algorithm to develop conjectures. 
We find a surprisingly rich collection of dense packing structures, including structures with internal holes and striated gaps; for $N=23$, the densest packing was a structure in which not all squares are aligned.  
In summary: when $N$ can be expressed as the sum of two integers -- $N=n_1^2+n_2^2$ -- the densest possible packing is a density one packing with squares arranged in rows that are at an orientation of tan$^-1(n_2/n_1)$ relative to the underlying torus.  
For $N$ = 6,11,14, and 27, we believe that the optimal packing is also a commensurate Bravais Lattice packing with density $N-2/N$ and resembles a bricklayer patterns with periodic gaps.  For $N=$ 12,21,22 and 23, we find that the densest configurations are non-Bravais lattice packings, including both regular lattices of holes and of skewed squares. These results are summarized in Table I within Section II.

In Section II, we present a summary analysis of the various structures we found for $N$ up to 27, including both commensurate Bravais lattice solutions and non-Bravais lattice solutions.  The packing motifs we found through analytic and numerical means are illustrated in this section via both drawn figures and images generated by our numerical simulations. We conclude Section II with a brief discussion of the expected entropy of density one packings, including an argument for the rotational variance of such packings as $N \rightarrow \infty$. In Section III, we provide further details of our numerical Monte Carlo simulated annealing simulation for the hard square system.
