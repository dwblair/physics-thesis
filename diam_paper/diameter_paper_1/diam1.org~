* Intro
** Motivation
*** Determines efficiency of cluster algorithms
*** Unexplored geometric property of random clusters
*** Places bounds on communication of processes in a network
*** Comparison to previous studies of the chemical distance
** Potts Model
*** The Model (refer to Sokal)
*** Connection to Random Cluster Model
** The chemical distance and the diameter
*** Definitions
*** [FIGURE] illustrating typical configuration
*** Mean field expectations
**** Upper critical dimensions for perc, Ising, three-state (with refs)
**** Work of Nachmias and Peres
*** d_min = 1.0 for q>5 (rationale??)
** Swedsen Wang Algorithm
*** See Sokal's description
** Measuring the Chemical Distance and the diameter
*** Methods in the literature
*** Our methods
** Simulation Details
*** Range of L, 16 to 128
*** Initial configuration random; discard first 10^5 iterations
*** Compare discard interval with autocorrelation time
*** Total run length for all systesm
*** Each data set consists of several runs combined
*** CPU time required in units of L^2 microseconds / iteration, type of processer
*** run the system for shorter times at higher dimensions (??)
** Data Analysis
*** Fit to power-law Ansatz D=AL^p using the standard weighted least-squares method
*** Fit points with lower cutoff of L >= L_{min} to minimize corrections to scaling
*** Choose fit with smallest L_{min} for which goodness of fit is reasonable (Q value within a certain range)
*** Error analysis
**** Data is taken at intervals assumed to be statistically independent
***** sigma = [fill in]
**** blocking method is used for comparison
***** brief blocking method description, references

** Table of results for D=3, q=1,2,3,4,5
** Preliminary results for D=6,4,8 for q=1,2,3 respectively
*** comparison with mean field expectations
