* Phase Transitions in Computational Complexity
** Background
*** Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
**** Examples
***** kSAT
***** Graph-coloring
***** Spin models
***** error-correcting codes
**** Observation of threshold behavior in CSP
**** Difficulties in tackling phase behavior of CSP
*** Proposal: study complexity of percolation model
** Percolation
*** The Model
*** Background / applications
** PRAM
*** Applications in comp sci
*** PRIORITY CRCW
** Parallel Algorithm for Percolation    
** Results    
*** D_2 vs. p for several system sizes L
*** log(D_2) vs. log(L)
*** Distribution of cluster sizes
**** logarithmic or power law? (power law --> algorithm will often fail)
