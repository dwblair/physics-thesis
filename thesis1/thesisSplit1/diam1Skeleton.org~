Diameter of Random Clusters

\begin{abstract}
 A relatively unexplored geometric property of Potts models clusters is their ``diameter'', $D$ -- the longest shortest path between any two points on the cluster. We report numerical results for the fractal dimension of the diameter, $D_{min}$ and the fractal dimension of the chemical distance, $d_{min}$, for 2D critical Potts clusters with $q=1,2,3,4,5$. We find that $D_{min} = d_{min}$ within numerical error. Test. Test2. Test3.
