We define a new qeometric quantity, the diameter, on Potts Model clusters, and determine the scaling of the diameter with system size for $q=1,2,3,4$ in 2D, and $q=2$ in 4D, using a particularly efficient algorithm for $q=1$.  We find that that scaling exponents for the diameter and the chemical distance are the same within error.
