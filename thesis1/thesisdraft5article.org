* Melting A
** Background re: melting
*** Theories of melting, 3D, 2D, bulk
**** 3D crystallites w/ stable surfaces melt from within via Born melting
     CLOSED: [2010-07-04 Sun 15:28]
In this case, melting can be viewed as nucleation and growth of fluid phase within the solid.
***** or yet another structure.
****** or even another
**** 2D large crystallites melt by two-step process via hexatic phase
**** 2D finite crystallites melt from perimeter
***** if melt from perimeter, dN/dt goes as $N^{1/2}$
*** Expectations for 2D finite crystallites    
** Experiment of Savage et. al
*** Setup
*** Tuneable Depletion potential
*** Results
**** N vs. t
**** $< psi6 >^2$ vs. N
**** $C_6$ vs. N, by layer
**** No dependence of fast-melting feature on initial cluster size or melting rate
** Simulations
*** Motivation
*** GROMACS System
*** Brownian dynamics
*** Simulated Depletion Potential
*** Simulated Lennard-Jones Potential
*** Results
**** N vs. t
**** $< psi6 >^2$ vs. N
**** $C_6$ vs. N, by layer
**** mean-square fluctuations in bond lengths
**** N vs. t for Lennard-Jones potential
**** Phase diagram showing lack of fluid phase with short-range potential
*** Discussion
* Melting B
** Background
*** Colloids: macroscopic system analogous to atomic system
**** similarites:
***** some phase behavior and phase transitions
***** can investiage atomic behavior via analogy
**** differences:
***** novel phases and phase behavior
***** superheated metastable states
***** interparticle potential readily modified
****** short-range repulsion, long-range repulsion, short-range repulsion and long-range attraction
*** Experiment by Savage et. al: novel melting kinetics
**** system: hard spheres with short-range attraction (relative to diameter)
**** experiment details
**** two-stage melting process
***** first melts from perimeter until reaches critical size
***** then breaks up into dense amorphous phase, which is unstable and rapidly evaporates
***** crossover occurs at typical 'magic size'
***** experiments: magic size ~ 20-30 particles
***** simulations: magic size ~ 40-50 particles
***** little dependence on temperature in experiment
***** (?) no dependence on temp in simulation?
**** possible explanations ruled out:
***** 'fast melting' behavior means rate not limited by thermal breaking of bonds
****** (since this would go as $N^(1/2)$
***** density decreases as crystallites shrink: melting kinetics not governed by surface tension
****** (?) does this contradict lacoste's argument?
****** (?) can i get data re: surface tension from tony, from simulations?
***** melting behavior not history dependent
****** no dependence on initial cluster size, melting rate in experiment
****** (?) no dependence in simulation ?
**** not classical nucleation of liquid within solid below critical crystal size
***** energetically unfavorable given positive surface energy
***** positive difference between chemical potentials of two phases
***** (?) understand this argument, relevant equations
*** Our hypothesis:  thermally-activated defects enhance melting rate
**** thermal introduction of disclinations favorable after critical size
**** presence of disclinations leads to concentration of stress
**** stress can be released through propagation of cracks
**** cracks propagate or not depending on range of potential
**** short-range, 'brittle' potential allow cracks to propagate
**** longer-range, 'ductile' potential doesn't
**** (?) is notion of a 'crack' in a liquid droplet sensible?
*** Simulations yield same result re:
*** Hypothesis: thermally-activated defects enhance melting rate in short-range, 2D system
*** Evidence:
**** Disclinations are implicated in breakup
***** GROMACS BD simulations, using depletion-like potential (from Part A)
***** exhibit fast-melting (from Part A)
***** order parameter decreases sharply (Part A)
***** ave disclination 'charge' reaches +1 at the magic size
**** Disclinations and two-stage melting affected by range of potential
***** Own BD simulations with screened Coulomb potential
***** Tune range of potential, short- and long-range (lambda values?)
***** Short-range: x percent fast melting; long-range: y percent fast melting; x>>y
