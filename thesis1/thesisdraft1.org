* Melting: Part A (science paper)
** Background
*** theory of 2-D melting
**** bulk: hexatic, two-stage
**** for finite crystallites: melting dominated by surface
**** range of potential as issue
**** imaging small crystallites difficult before savage's technique
** Experiments by Savage et. al
** Depletion potential
*** range ~ 10 % of particle diameter
*** observation: sublimation at steady rate until characteristic size, then enhanced melting
*** Figure: N vs t (Fig 2. from savage et. al)
*** Figure: Q_6 vs t (Fig 3. from savage et. al)
** Simulations
** Motivation
*** confirm that odd hydrodynamics didn't play a role
*** explore role of range of potential on melting
** Simulation algorithm / details
*** brownian dynamics simulation
**** theory
**** algorithm
**** form of the interaction potential used
***** A-O depletion model
***** 'Blairium' -- A-O, but avoid infinite Brownian dynamics force
*** phase diagram exploration
** Results
*** short-range potential (~10%)
**** N vs. t
**** Q_6 vs. t
**** Q_6 vs. N
*** longer-range potential (~80%)
** Discussion
** Future work
*** 3D
*** curved surfaces
*** non-spherical molecules
* Melting: Part B (moumita)
** Background
*** Reference to experimental work and theory work in melting A chapter
*** Theory: range of potential controls brittle/ductile transition
**** brittle / ductile theory
*** When crystallites are sufficiently brittle, melting is mediated by defects
**** alternative melting models
** Theory
*** Determine energy cost, E, of creating a disclination on flat 2D Membrane
*** For thermally-activated disclinations, K_B T ~ E
*** Disclinations create internal stresses: relieved by cracking
*** potential energy penalty, V, of crack in 2D sheet
*** minimize V to find critical crack length, l_c(Y,gamma)
*** estimate Y, gamma for simulations
*** use these to find a, critical average interparticle separation
*** this allows us to find a critical potential range, a
** Simluations
*** Brownian dynamics background (refer to previous)
*** My code (include in thesis) vs. Gromacs
*** New form of the interparticle potential
**** plot for short-range, longer-range
*** Phase behavior / melting temperature
**** brittle
**** ductile
*** Results
**** For Brittle and Ductile cases:
***** N vs. t
***** Q_6 vs. (N-N*)
***** Q_6 vs. (N-N*)
***** Ave. topological charge vs. (N-N*)
** Discussion
**** Alternative theories: e.g. Lacoste
** Code
* Diameter of Random Clusters
** Background
*** Applications and physical realizations of the potts model
*** Interesting properties of potts model clusters
**** mass
**** perimeter
**** chemical distance
***** literature review
****** applications
***** current understanding
***** no established relationship to other scaling exponents
**** diameter
***** graph theoretic definition
***** applications
****** relevant to efficiency of simulations
****** communication on a potts network
***** mean field expectations
*** Review of potts model
**** overview
**** phase behavior for q=1,2,3,4, D=1,2,3,4,infinite
** Simulations
*** swendsen wang algorithm
*** method: determining chemical distance
**** review methods in literature
**** proposed trick
**** our method (useful when periodic boundaries)
**** estimated algorithmic complexity
*** simulation details
**** autocorrelation time / independence
**** scaling methods
** Results
*** 2D q=1,2,3,4
*** 3D q=1,2
*** 4D q=2
* Phase Transitions in Computational Complexity
** Background
*** Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
**** Examples
***** kSAT
***** Graph-coloring
***** Spin models
***** error-correcting codes
**** Observation of threshold behavior in CSP
**** Difficulties in tackling phase behavior of CSP
*** Proposal: study complexity of percolation model
** Percolation
*** The Model
*** Background / applications
** PRAM
*** Applications in comp sci
*** PRIORITY CRCW
** Parallel Algorithm for Percolation
** Results
*** D_2 vs. p for several system sizes L
*** log(D_2) vs. log(L)
*** Distribution of cluster sizes
**** logarithmic or power law? (power law --> algorithm will often fail)
