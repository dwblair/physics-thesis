* Melting A
** Background re: melting
*** Theories of melting, 3D, 2D, bulk
**** 3D crystallites w/ stable surfaces melt from within via Born melting
In this case, melting can be viewed as nucleation and growth of fluid phase within the solid.
***** or yet another structure.
****** or even another
**** 2D large crystallites melt by two-step process via hexatic phase
**** 2D finite crystallites melt from perimeter
***** if melt from perimeter, dN/dt goes as $N^{1/2}$
*** Expectations for 2D finite crystallites
** Experiment of Savage et. al
*** Setup
*** Tunable Depletion potential
*** Results
**** N vs. t
**** $< psi6 >^2$ vs. N
**** $C_6$ vs. N, by layer
**** No dependence of fast-melting feature on initial cluster size or melting rate
** Simulations
*** Motivation
*** GROMACS System
*** Brownian dynamics
*** Simulated Depletion Potential
*** Simulated Lennard-Jones Potential
*** Results
**** N vs. t
**** $< psi6 >^2$ vs. N
**** $C_6$ vs. N, by layer
**** mean-square fluctuations in bond lengths
**** N vs. t for Lennard-Jones potential
**** Phase diagram showing lack of fluid phase with short-range potential
*** Discussion
* Melting B
** Background
*** Hypothesis: thermally-activated defects enhance melting rate in short-range 2D system
** Simulation Methods
*** Gromacs system
Here's a good test. \cite{Deng2009}
*** Brownian Dynamics
*** Characteristics of Simulated Depletion Potential
*** Initial configurations
** Results
*** N vs t
*** Order vs. N
*** Breakdown by layers
** Conclusions
* Diameter of Random Clusters
** Background
** Simulations
** Results
* Phase Transitions in Computational Complexity
** Background
*** Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
**** Examples
***** kSAT
***** Graph-coloring
***** Spin models
***** error-correcting codes
**** Observation of threshold behavior in CSP
**** Difficulties in tackling phase behavior of CSP
*** Proposal: study complexity of percolation model
** Percolation
*** The Model
*** Background / applications
** PRAM
*** Applications in comp sci
*** PRIORITY CRCW
** Parallel Algorithm for Percolation
** Results
*** D_2 vs. p for several system sizes L
*** log(D_2) vs. log(L)
*** Distribution of cluster sizes
**** logarithmic or power law? (power law --> algorithm will often fail)
