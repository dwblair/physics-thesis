@misc{Boucheron2000,
abstract = {An instance of the square packing problem consists of n squares with independently, uniformly distributed side-lengths and independently, uniformly distributed locations on the unit d-dimensional torus. A packing is a maximum family of pairwise disjoint squares. The one-dimensional version of the problem is the classical random interval packing problem. This paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of packings as n tends towards infinity while d = 2. Coffman et al. recently proved that the average size of packing is (n d=(d+1) ). Using partitioning techniques, sub-additivity and concentration of measure arguments, we show first that, after normalization by n 2=3 , the size of two-dimensional square packings tends in probability towards a genuine limit . Straightforward concentration arguments show that large fluctuations of order n 2=3 should have probability vanishing exponentially fast with n 2=3 . Even though remains unknown, using a change of measure argument, we show tha...},

@article{Odriozola2009,
abstract = {In this work a replica exchange Monte Carlo scheme which considers an extended isobaric-isothermal ensemble with respect to pressure is applied to study hard spheres (HSs). The idea behind the proposal is expanding volume instead of increasing temperature to let crowded systems characterized by dominant repulsive interactions to unblock, and so, to produce sampling from disjoint configurations. The method produces, in a single parallel run, the complete HS equation of state. Thus, the first order fluid-solid transition is captured. The obtained results well agree with previous calculations. This approach seems particularly useful to treat purely entropy-driven systems such as hard body and nonadditive hard mixtures, where temperature plays a trivial role.},

@article{Bernard2009,
abstract = {In this paper we present the event-chain algorithms, which are fast Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods for hard spheres and related systems. In a single move of these rejection-free methods, an arbitrarily long chain of particles is displaced, and long-range coherent motion can be induced. Numerical simulations show that event-chain algorithms clearly outperform the conventional Metropolis methods. Irreversible versions of the algorithms, which violate detailed balance, improve the speed of the method even further.},
