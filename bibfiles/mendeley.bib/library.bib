Fortuin-Kasteleyn random-cluster model, which generalizes the Swendsen-Wang

build very large clusters using very little computer memory by limiting the
maximum number of sites for which we maintain state information to a number of
the order of the number of sites in the largest chemical shell of the cluster
being created. The memory required to grow a cluster of mass s is of the order
of \$s\^{}\backslash theta\$ bytes where \$\backslash theta\$ ranges from 0.4 for 2-dimensional lattices
to 0.5 for 6- (or higher)-dimensional lattices. We use this method to estimate
\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}\$, the exponent relating the minimum path \$\backslash ell\$ to the
Euclidean distance r, for 4D and 5D hypercubic lattices. Analyzing both site

\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}=1.812\backslash pm 0.006\$ (5D). In order to determine
\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}\$ to high precision, and without bias, it was necessary to
first find precise values for the percolation threshold, \$p\_c\$:

Carlo algorithm allows us to observe a dynamic liquid-glass transition at a

furthermore apply Monte Carlo methods which sample the Boltzmann equilibrium

even far within the glass. We find that the dynamical transition is not
accompanied by a thermodynamic transition in this two-dimensional system so
that the glass is thermodynamically identical to the liquid. Moreover, we
scrutinize the polydispersity-driven transition from the crystal into the
disordered phase (liquid or glass). Our results indicate the presence of a
continuous (Kosterlitz-Thouless type) transition upon increase of the

Of particular interest are so called cluster methods, which exploit the

Cluster algorithms appear, among other systems, in classical spin models, such
as the Ising model, in lattice quantum models (bosons, quantum spins and
related systems) and in hard spheres and other `entropic' systems for which the
configurational energy is either zero or infinite. In this chapter, we discuss

the dual lattice and is formulated in terms of bond-variables and can therefore
be generalized to other two-dimensional models that can be formulated in terms
of bond-variables. We also discuss two related algorithms formulated on the
direct lattice, applicable in any dimension. These latter algorithms turn out
to be less efficient but of considerable intrinsic interest. We show how such

the worms to erase themselves. Explicit proofs of detailed balance are given
for all the algorithms. In terms of computational efficiency the dual
geometrical worm algorithm is comparable to well known cluster algorithms such
as the Swendsen-Wang and Wolff algorithms, however, it is quite different in

abstract = {A detailed description is provided of a new Worm Algorithm, enabling the
accurate computation of thermodynamic properties of quantum many-body systems
in continuous space, at finite temperature. The algorithm is formulated within
the general Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) scheme, but also allows one to
perform quantum simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, as well as to
compute off-diagonal imaginary-time correlation functions, such as the
Matsubara Green function, simultaneously with diagonal observables. Another
important innovation consists of the expansion of the attractive part of the
pairwise potential energy into elementary (diagrammatic) contributions, which
are then statistically sampled. This affords a complete microscopic account of
the long-range part of the potential energy, while keeping the computational
complexity of all updates independent of the size of the simulated system. The
computational scheme allows for efficient calculations of the superfluid
fraction and off-diagonal correlations in space-time, for system sizes which
are orders of magnitude larger than those accessible to conventional PIMC. We
present illustrative results for the superfluid transition in bulk liquid
helium-four in two and three dimensions, as well as the calculation of the

abstract = {A multiple-trait QTL mapping method using least squares is described. It is presented as an extension of a single-trait method for use with three-generation, outbred pedigrees. The multiple-trait framework allows formal testing of whether the same QTL affects more than one trait (i.e., a pleiotropic QTL) or whether more than one linked QTL are segregating. Several approaches to the testing procedure are presented and their suitability discussed. The performance of the method is investigated by simulation. As previously found, multitrait analyses increase the power to detect a pleiotropic QTL and the precision of its location estimate. With enough information, discrimination between alternative genetic models is possible.},

@article{Hansen2003,
abstract = {Evolvability is the ability to respond to a selective challenge. This requires the capacity to produce the right kind of variation for selection to act upon. To understand evolvability we therefore need to understand the variational properties of biological organisms. Modularity is a variational property, which has been linked to evolvability. If different characters are able to vary independently, selection will be able to optimize each character separately without interference. But although modularity seems like a good design principle for an evolvable organism, it does not therefore follow that it is the only design that can achieve evolvability. In this essay I analyze the effects of modularity and, more generally, pleiotropy on evolvability. Although, pleiotropy causes interference between the adaptation of different characters, it also increases the variational potential of those characters. The most evolvable genetic architectures may often be those with an intermediate level of integration among characters, and in particular those where pleiotropic effects are variable and able to compensate for each other's constraints.},

Our motivation comes from the nervous system, where neurons process multidimensional signals into a binary sequence of responses (spikes). In a small noise limit, we derive a general equation for the decision boundary that locally relates its curvature to the probability distribution of inputs. We show that for Gaussian inputs the optimal boundaries are planar, but for non-Gaussian inputs the curvature is nonzero. As an example, we consider exponentially distributed inputs, which are known to approximate a variety of signals from natural environment.},

abstract = {Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.},

abstract = {As perceived by Darwin, evolutionary adaptation by the processes of mutation and selection is difficult to understand for complex features that are the product of numerous traits acting in concert, for example the eye or the apparatus of flight. Typically, mutations simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic characters. This phenomenon is known as pleiotropy. The impact of pleiotropy on evolution has for decades been the subject of formal analysis. Some authors have suggested that pleiotropy can impede evolutionary progress (a so-called 'cost of complexity'). The plausibility of various phenomena attributed to pleiotropy depends on how many traits are affected by each mutation and on our understanding of the correlation between the number of traits affected by each gene substitution and the size of mutational effects on individual traits. Here we show, by studying pleiotropy in mice with the use of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting skeletal characters, that most QTLs affect a relatively small subset of traits and that a substitution at a QTL has an effect on each trait that increases with the total number of traits affected. This suggests that evolution of higher organisms does not suffer a 'cost of complexity' because most mutations affect few traits and the size of the effects does not decrease with pleiotropy.},

Dynactin, a large multi-subunit activator of dynein, docks cargo to the motor and may enhance dynein processivity. Here, we show that individual fluorescently labelled dynein-dynactin complexes exhibit bidirectional and processive motility towards both the plus and minus ends of microtubules. The dependence of this activity on substrate ATP concentration, nucleotide analogues and inhibitors suggests that bidirectional motility is an active energy-transduction property of dynein-dynactin motor mechano-chemistry. The unique motility characteristics observed may reflect the flexibility of the dynein structure that leads to an enhanced ability to navigate around obstacles in the cell.},

abstract = {We review of the interface between (theoretical) physics and information for
non-experts. The origin of information as related to the notion of entropy is
described, first in the context of thermodynamics then in the context of
statistical mechanics. A close examination of the foundations of statistical
mechanics and the need to reconcile the probabilistic and deterministic views
of the world leads us to a discussion of chaotic dynamics, where information
plays a crucial role in quantifying predictability. We then discuss a variety
of fundamental issues that emerge in defining information and how one must
exercise care in discussing concepts such as order, disorder, and incomplete
knowledge. We also discuss an alternative form of entropy and its possible
relevance for nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
In the final part of the paper we discuss how quantum mechanics gives rise to
the very different concept of quantum information. Entirely new possibilities
for information storage and computation are possible due to the massive
parallel processing inherent in quantum mechanics. We also point out how
entropy can be extended to apply to quantum mechanics to provide a useful
measurement for quantum entanglement.
Finally we make a small excursion to the interface betweeen quantum theory
and general relativity, where one is confronted with an "ultimate information
paradox" posed by the physics of Black Holes.
In this review we have limited ourselves; not all relevant topics that touch
on physics and information could be covered.},

The mechanical energy is used for moving in discrete steps along the cytoskeleton and carrying a molecular load. High resolution single molecule recordings of motor steps appear as a stochastic sequence of dwells, resembling a staircase. Staircase data can also be obtained from other molecular machines such as F1 -ATPase, RNA polymerase, or topoisomerase. We developed a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates the rate constants between different conformational states of the protein, including motor steps. We model the motor with a periodic Markov model that reflects the repetitive chemistry of the motor step. We estimated the kinetics from the idealized dwell-sequence by numerical maximization of the likelihood function for discrete-time Markov models. This approach eliminates the need for missed event correction. The algorithm can fit kinetic models of arbitrary complexity, such as uniform or alternating step chemistry, reversible or irreversible kinetics, ATP concentration and mechanical force-dependent rates, etc. The method allows global fitting across stationary and nonstationary experimental conditions, and user-defined a priori constraints on rate constants. The algorithm was tested with simulated data, and implemented in the free QuB software.},

simple mechanism for the emergence of a critical value q\_c, such that for q<q\_c
the interface becomes a fractal with a vanishing interfacial tension at the
critical point, while for q>q\_c the interfacial width diverges at a finite
value of the tension, indicating a first-order transition. The value of the
Widom exponent for q<q\_c within this approximation is in fair agreement with
known exact values. Some comments are made on the case of quenched randomness.

exponent z is exactly vanishing. We simulate in this way a 3D Potts model in

abstract = {We discuss the implementation of a directed geometrical worm algorithm for
the study of quantum link-current models. In this algorithm Monte Carlo updates
are made through the biased reptation of a worm through the lattice. A directed
algorithm is an algorithm where, during the construction of the worm, the
probability for erasing the immediately preceding part of the worm, when adding
a new part,is minimal. We introduce a simple numerical procedure for minimizing
this probability. The procedure only depends on appropriately defined local
probabilities and should be generally applicable. Furthermore we show how
correlation functions, C(r,tau) can be straightforwardly obtained from the
probability of a worm to reach a site (r,tau) away from its starting point
independent of whether or not a directed version of the algorithm is used.
Detailed analytical proofs of the validity of the Monte Carlo algorithms are
presented for both the directed and un-directed geometrical worm algorithms.
Results for auto-correlation times and Green functions are presented for the
quantum rotor model.},

Carlo procedure which employs nonlocal changes of worldline configurations,
determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of
quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and
graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented
directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path
integral and with the stochastic series expansion (SSE). It overcomes many of
the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are
reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal
operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases,
infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the
fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled
efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal ones. The method has been applied
successfully to a variety of models for spin and charge degrees of freedom,
including Heisenberg and XYZ spin models, hard-core bosons, Hubbard, and
tJ-models. Due to the improved efficiency, precise calculations of asymptotic

We find profound differences in the phase behavior of these models, which can be attributed to their different packing properties. Interestingly, bimodal orientational distribution functions are found in the nematic phase of hard rectangles, which cause a certain degree of biaxial order, albeit metastable with respect to spatially ordered phases. This feature is absent in discorectangles, which always show unimodal behavior. This result may be relevant in the light of recent experimental results which have confirmed the existence of biaxial phases. We expect that some perturbation of the particle shapes (either a certain degree of polydispersity or even bimodal dispersity in the aspect ratios) may actually destabilize spatially ordered phases thereby stabilizing the biaxial phase.},

abstract = {We examine the ordering of hard rods on the surface of a sphere using computer simulations. As predicted by previous theories of thin nematic shells we observe four s = + 1/2 defects. However, the predicted tetrahedral symmetry for the defects and the "baseball" director configuration is not observed. Instead the four defects are located, on average, on a great circle which splits the sphere into two hemispheres, each of which has a splay dominated director configuration. We argue that this result occurs as the bend elastic constant for hard rods is much larger than the splay elastic constant.},

abstract = {The orientational and positional ordering of the two-dimensional system of hard zigzag particles has been investigated by means of Onsager theory. Analytical results are obtained for the transition densities of the isotropic-nematic and the nematic-smectic phase transitions. It is shown that the stability of the nematic and smectic phases is very sensitive to the molecular shape. In the hard needle limit, only the isotropic-nematic phase transition takes place, while increasing the tail length and the bent angle between the central core and the tails destabilizes the nematic phase. On the other hand the stability of the smectic phase is due to the increasing excluded area cost with bent angle and the tail length. The zigzag particles pack in a layered structure such that they are tilted and form semi-ideal gas in the layers to push the high cost excluded area regions into the interstitial regions. The predictions of Onsager theory are in good agreement with MC simulation data.},

abstract = {We study experimentally the nonequilibrium phase behaviour of a horizontal
monolayer of macroscopic rods. The motion of the rods in two dimensions is
driven by vibrations in the vertical direction. Aside from the control
variables of packing fraction and aspect ratio that are typically explored in
molecular liquid crystalline systems, due to the macroscopic size of the
particles we are also able to investigate the effect of the precise shape of
the particle on the steady states of this driven system. We find that the shape
plays an important role in determining the nature of the orientational ordering
at high packing fraction. Cylindrical particles show substantial tetratic
correlations over a range of aspect ratios where spherocylinders have
previously been shown by Bates et al (JCP 112, 10034 (2000)) to undergo
transitions between isotropic and nematic phases. Particles that are thinner at
the ends (rolling pins or bails) show nematic ordering over the same range of
aspect ratios, with a well-established nematic phase at large aspect ratio and
a defect-ridden nematic state with large-scale swirling motion at small aspect
ratios. Finally, long-grain, basmati rice, whose geometry is intermediate
between the two shapes above, shows phases with strong indications of smectic
order.},

@article{Khandkar2008,
abstract = {Deposition and evaporation of infinitely thin hard rods (needles) is studied
in two dimensions using Monte Carlo simulations. The ratio of deposition to
evaporation rates controls the equilibrium density of rods, and increasing it
leads to an entropy-driven transition to a nematic phase in which both static
and dynamical orientational correlation functions decay as power laws, with
exponents varying continuously with deposition-evaporation rate ratio. Our
results for the onset of the power-law phase agree with those for a conserved
number of rods. At a coarse-grained level, the dynamics of the non-conserved
angle field is described by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. Predicted relations
between the exponents of the quadrupolar and octupolar correlation functions
are borne out by our numerical results. We explore the effects of spatial
inhomogeneity in the deposition-evaporation ratio by simulations, entropy-based
arguments and a study of the new terms introduced in the free energy. The
primary effect is that needles tend to align along the local spatial gradient
of the ratio. A uniform gradient thus induces a uniformly aligned state, as
does a gradient which varies randomly in magnitude and sign, but acts only in
one direction. Random variations of deposition-evaporation rates in both
directions induce frustration, resulting in a state with glassy
characteristics.},

abstract = {We have calculated the phase diagrams of one--component fluids made of five
types of biaxial particles differing in their cross sections. The orientation
of the principal particle axis is fixed in space, while the second axis is
allowed to freely rotate. We have constructed a free-energy density functional
based on fundamental--measure theory to study the relative stability of nematic
and smectic phases with uniaxial, biaxial and tetratic symmetries. Minimization
of the density functional allows us to study the phase behavior of the biaxial
particles as a function of the cross-section geometry. For low values of the
aspect ratio of the particle cross section, we obtain smectic phases with
tetratic symmetry, although metastable with respect to the crystal, as our MC
simulation study indicates. For large particle aspect ratios and in analogy
with previous work [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 5, 3700 (2003)], we have found a
four--phase point where four spinodals, corresponding to phase transitions
between phases with different symmetries, meet together. The location of this
point is quite sensitive to particle cross section, which suggests that
optimizing the particle geometry could be a useful criterion in the design of
colloidal particles that can exhibit an increased stability of the biaxial
nematic phase with respect to other competing phases with spatial order.},

A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals.},
