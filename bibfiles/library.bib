abstract = {We study the satisfiability of random Boolean expressions built from many clauses with K variables per clause (K-satisfiability). Expressions with a ratio alpha of clauses to variables less than a threshold alphac are almost always satisfiable, whereas those with a ratio above this threshold are almost always unsatisfiable. We show the existence of an intermediate phase below alphac, where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in search algorithms. We introduce a class of optimization algorithms that can deal with these metastable states; one such algorithm has been tested successfully on the largest existing benchmark of K-satisfiability.},

abstract = {We studied the kinetics of sublimating crystals with single-particle resolution by experiments with colloidal spheres and by computer simulations. A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals.},

abstract = {A multiple-trait QTL mapping method using least squares is described. It is presented as an extension of a single-trait method for use with three-generation, outbred pedigrees. The multiple-trait framework allows formal testing of whether the same QTL affects more than one trait (i.e., a pleiotropic QTL) or whether more than one linked QTL are segregating. Several approaches to the testing procedure are presented and their suitability discussed. The performance of the method is investigated by simulation. As previously found, multitrait analyses increase the power to detect a pleiotropic QTL and the precision of its location estimate. With enough information, discrimination between alternative genetic models is possible.},

build very large clusters using very little computer memory by limiting the
maximum number of sites for which we maintain state information to a number of
the order of the number of sites in the largest chemical shell of the cluster

of \$s\^{}\backslash theta\$ bytes where \$\backslash theta\$ ranges from 0.4 for 2-dimensional lattices
to 0.5 for 6- (or higher)-dimensional lattices. We use this method to estimate
\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}\$, the exponent relating the minimum path \$\backslash ell\$ to the
Euclidean distance r, for 4D and 5D hypercubic lattices. Analyzing both site
and bond percolation, we find \$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}=1.607\backslash pm 0.005\$ (4D) and
\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}=1.812\backslash pm 0.006\$ (5D). In order to determine
\$d\_\{\backslash scriptsize min\}\$ to high precision, and without bias, it was necessary to
first find precise values for the percolation threshold, \$p\_c\$:
\$p\_c=0.196889\backslash pm 0.000003\$ (4D) and \$p\_c=0.14081\backslash pm 0.00001\$ (5D) for site and

percolation. We also calculate the Fisher exponent, \$\backslash tau\$, determined in the

accompanied by a thermodynamic transition in this two-dimensional system so
that the glass is thermodynamically identical to the liquid. Moreover, we
scrutinize the polydispersity-driven transition from the crystal into the

@article{Wagner2008,
abstract = {As perceived by Darwin, evolutionary adaptation by the processes of mutation and selection is difficult to understand for complex features that are the product of numerous traits acting in concert, for example the eye or the apparatus of flight. Typically, mutations simultaneously affect multiple phenotypic characters. This phenomenon is known as pleiotropy. The impact of pleiotropy on evolution has for decades been the subject of formal analysis. Some authors have suggested that pleiotropy can impede evolutionary progress (a so-called 'cost of complexity'). The plausibility of various phenomena attributed to pleiotropy depends on how many traits are affected by each mutation and on our understanding of the correlation between the number of traits affected by each gene substitution and the size of mutational effects on individual traits. Here we show, by studying pleiotropy in mice with the use of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting skeletal characters, that most QTLs affect a relatively small subset of traits and that a substitution at a QTL has an effect on each trait that increases with the total number of traits affected. This suggests that evolution of higher organisms does not suffer a 'cost of complexity' because most mutations affect few traits and the size of the effects does not decrease with pleiotropy.},

abstract = {We consider here how to separate multidimensional signals into two categories, such that the binary decision transmits the maximum possible information about those signals. Our motivation comes from the nervous system, where neurons process multidimensional signals into a binary sequence of responses (spikes). In a small noise limit, we derive a general equation for the decision boundary that locally relates its curvature to the probability distribution of inputs. We show that for Gaussian inputs the optimal boundaries are planar, but for non-Gaussian inputs the curvature is nonzero. As an example, we consider exponentially distributed inputs, which are known to approximate a variety of signals from natural environment.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein is the primary molecular motor responsible for transport of vesicles, organelles, proteins and RNA cargoes from the periphery of the cell towards the nucleus along the microtubule cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. Dynactin, a large multi-subunit activator of dynein, docks cargo to the motor and may enhance dynein processivity. Here, we show that individual fluorescently labelled dynein-dynactin complexes exhibit bidirectional and processive motility towards both the plus and minus ends of microtubules. The dependence of this activity on substrate ATP concentration, nucleotide analogues and inhibitors suggests that bidirectional motility is an active energy-transduction property of dynein-dynactin motor mechano-chemistry. The unique motility characteristics observed may reflect the flexibility of the dynein structure that leads to an enhanced ability to navigate around obstacles in the cell.},

perform quantum simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, as well as to
compute off-diagonal imaginary-time correlation functions, such as the
Matsubara Green function, simultaneously with diagonal observables. Another
important innovation consists of the expansion of the attractive part of the
pairwise potential energy into elementary (diagrammatic) contributions, which
are then statistically sampled. This affords a complete microscopic account of
the long-range part of the potential energy, while keeping the computational
complexity of all updates independent of the size of the simulated system. The
computational scheme allows for efficient calculations of the superfluid
fraction and off-diagonal correlations in space-time, for system sizes which
are orders of magnitude larger than those accessible to conventional PIMC. We
present illustrative results for the superfluid transition in bulk liquid
helium-four in two and three dimensions, as well as the calculation of the

In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.},

direct lattice, applicable in any dimension. These latter algorithms turn out
to be less efficient but of considerable intrinsic interest. We show how such

the worms to erase themselves. Explicit proofs of detailed balance are given
for all the algorithms. In terms of computational efficiency the dual
geometrical worm algorithm is comparable to well known cluster algorithms such
as the Swendsen-Wang and Wolff algorithms, however, it is quite different in

abstract = {Evolvability is the ability to respond to a selective challenge. This requires the capacity to produce the right kind of variation for selection to act upon. To understand evolvability we therefore need to understand the variational properties of biological organisms. Modularity is a variational property, which has been linked to evolvability. If different characters are able to vary independently, selection will be able to optimize each character separately without interference. But although modularity seems like a good design principle for an evolvable organism, it does not therefore follow that it is the only design that can achieve evolvability. In this essay I analyze the effects of modularity and, more generally, pleiotropy on evolvability. Although, pleiotropy causes interference between the adaptation of different characters, it also increases the variational potential of those characters. The most evolvable genetic architectures may often be those with an intermediate level of integration among characters, and in particular those where pleiotropic effects are variable and able to compensate for each other's constraints.},

abstract = {We review of the interface between (theoretical) physics and information for
non-experts. The origin of information as related to the notion of entropy is
described, first in the context of thermodynamics then in the context of
statistical mechanics. A close examination of the foundations of statistical
mechanics and the need to reconcile the probabilistic and deterministic views
of the world leads us to a discussion of chaotic dynamics, where information
plays a crucial role in quantifying predictability. We then discuss a variety
of fundamental issues that emerge in defining information and how one must
exercise care in discussing concepts such as order, disorder, and incomplete
knowledge. We also discuss an alternative form of entropy and its possible
relevance for nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
In the final part of the paper we discuss how quantum mechanics gives rise to
the very different concept of quantum information. Entirely new possibilities
for information storage and computation are possible due to the massive
parallel processing inherent in quantum mechanics. We also point out how
entropy can be extended to apply to quantum mechanics to provide a useful
measurement for quantum entanglement.
Finally we make a small excursion to the interface betweeen quantum theory
and general relativity, where one is confronted with an "ultimate information
paradox" posed by the physics of Black Holes.
In this review we have limited ourselves; not all relevant topics that touch
on physics and information could be covered.},

0.67 while the critical RSB transition point is located at p\_c = 0.7450, to be
compared with the corresponding Shannon bound 1-R. For the binary symmetric
channel (BSC) we show that the low temperature reentrant behavior of the
dynamical transition line, observed within the RS ansatz, changes within the
RSB theory; the location of the dynamical transition point occurring at higher
values of the channel noise. Possible practical implications to improve the
performances of the state-of-the-art error correcting codes are discussed.},

abstract = {We discuss the implementation of a directed geometrical worm algorithm for
the study of quantum link-current models. In this algorithm Monte Carlo updates
are made through the biased reptation of a worm through the lattice. A directed
algorithm is an algorithm where, during the construction of the worm, the
probability for erasing the immediately preceding part of the worm, when adding
a new part,is minimal. We introduce a simple numerical procedure for minimizing
this probability. The procedure only depends on appropriately defined local
probabilities and should be generally applicable. Furthermore we show how
correlation functions, C(r,tau) can be straightforwardly obtained from the
probability of a worm to reach a site (r,tau) away from its starting point
independent of whether or not a directed version of the algorithm is used.
Detailed analytical proofs of the validity of the Monte Carlo algorithms are
presented for both the directed and un-directed geometrical worm algorithms.
Results for auto-correlation times and Green functions are presented for the
quantum rotor model.},

abstract = {Molecular motors, such as kinesin, myosin, or dynein, convert chemical energy into mechanical energy by hydrolyzing ATP. The mechanical energy is used for moving in discrete steps along the cytoskeleton and carrying a molecular load. High resolution single molecule recordings of motor steps appear as a stochastic sequence of dwells, resembling a staircase. Staircase data can also be obtained from other molecular machines such as F1 -ATPase, RNA polymerase, or topoisomerase. We developed a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates the rate constants between different conformational states of the protein, including motor steps. We model the motor with a periodic Markov model that reflects the repetitive chemistry of the motor step. We estimated the kinetics from the idealized dwell-sequence by numerical maximization of the likelihood function for discrete-time Markov models. This approach eliminates the need for missed event correction. The algorithm can fit kinetic models of arbitrary complexity, such as uniform or alternating step chemistry, reversible or irreversible kinetics, ATP concentration and mechanical force-dependent rates, etc. The method allows global fitting across stationary and nonstationary experimental conditions, and user-defined a priori constraints on rate constants. The algorithm was tested with simulated data, and implemented in the free QuB software.},

@article{Evertz1997,
abstract = {A review of the Loop Algorithm, its generalizations, and its relation to some
other Monte Carlo techniques is given. The loop algorithm is a Quantum Monte
Carlo procedure which employs nonlocal changes of worldline configurations,
determined by local stochastic decisions. It is based on a formulation of
quantum models of any dimension in an extended ensemble of worldlines and
graphs, and is related to Swendsen-Wang algorithms. It can be represented
directly on an operator level, both with a continuous imaginary time path
integral and with the stochastic series expansion (SSE). It overcomes many of
the difficulties of traditional worldline simulations. Autocorrelations are
reduced by orders of magnitude. Grand-canonical ensembles, off-diagonal
operators, and variance reduced estimators are accessible. In some cases,
infinite systems can be simulated. For a restricted class of models, the
fermion sign problem can be overcome. Transverse magnetic fields are handled
efficiently, in contrast to strong diagonal ones. The method has been applied
successfully to a variety of models for spin and charge degrees of freedom,
including Heisenberg and XYZ spin models, hard-core bosons, Hubbard, and
tJ-models. Due to the improved efficiency, precise calculations of asymptotic
behavior and of quantum critical exponents have been possible.},

abstract = {Using a version of density-functional theory which combines Onsager approximation and fundamental-measure theory for spatially nonuniform phases, we have studied the phase diagram of freely rotating hard rectangles and hard discorectangles. We find profound differences in the phase behavior of these models, which can be attributed to their different packing properties. Interestingly, bimodal orientational distribution functions are found in the nematic phase of hard rectangles, which cause a certain degree of biaxial order, albeit metastable with respect to spatially ordered phases. This feature is absent in discorectangles, which always show unimodal behavior. This result may be relevant in the light of recent experimental results which have confirmed the existence of biaxial phases. We expect that some perturbation of the particle shapes (either a certain degree of polydispersity or even bimodal dispersity in the aspect ratios) may actually destabilize spatially ordered phases thereby stabilizing the biaxial phase.},

abstract = {We study experimentally the nonequilibrium phase behaviour of a horizontal
monolayer of macroscopic rods. The motion of the rods in two dimensions is
driven by vibrations in the vertical direction. Aside from the control
variables of packing fraction and aspect ratio that are typically explored in
molecular liquid crystalline systems, due to the macroscopic size of the
particles we are also able to investigate the effect of the precise shape of
the particle on the steady states of this driven system. We find that the shape
plays an important role in determining the nature of the orientational ordering
at high packing fraction. Cylindrical particles show substantial tetratic
correlations over a range of aspect ratios where spherocylinders have
previously been shown by Bates et al (JCP 112, 10034 (2000)) to undergo
transitions between isotropic and nematic phases. Particles that are thinner at
the ends (rolling pins or bails) show nematic ordering over the same range of
aspect ratios, with a well-established nematic phase at large aspect ratio and
a defect-ridden nematic state with large-scale swirling motion at small aspect
ratios. Finally, long-grain, basmati rice, whose geometry is intermediate
between the two shapes above, shows phases with strong indications of smectic
order.},

@article{Khandkar2008,
abstract = {Deposition and evaporation of infinitely thin hard rods (needles) is studied
in two dimensions using Monte Carlo simulations. The ratio of deposition to
evaporation rates controls the equilibrium density of rods, and increasing it
leads to an entropy-driven transition to a nematic phase in which both static
and dynamical orientational correlation functions decay as power laws, with
exponents varying continuously with deposition-evaporation rate ratio. Our
results for the onset of the power-law phase agree with those for a conserved
number of rods. At a coarse-grained level, the dynamics of the non-conserved
angle field is described by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. Predicted relations
between the exponents of the quadrupolar and octupolar correlation functions
are borne out by our numerical results. We explore the effects of spatial
inhomogeneity in the deposition-evaporation ratio by simulations, entropy-based
arguments and a study of the new terms introduced in the free energy. The
primary effect is that needles tend to align along the local spatial gradient
of the ratio. A uniform gradient thus induces a uniformly aligned state, as
does a gradient which varies randomly in magnitude and sign, but acts only in
one direction. Random variations of deposition-evaporation rates in both
directions induce frustration, resulting in a state with glassy
characteristics.},

Analytical results are obtained for the transition densities of the isotropic-nematic and the nematic-smectic phase transitions. It is shown that the stability of the nematic and smectic phases is very sensitive to the molecular shape. In the hard needle limit, only the isotropic-nematic phase transition takes place, while increasing the tail length and the bent angle between the central core and the tails destabilizes the nematic phase. On the other hand the stability of the smectic phase is due to the increasing excluded area cost with bent angle and the tail length. The zigzag particles pack in a layered structure such that they are tilted and form semi-ideal gas in the layers to push the high cost excluded area regions into the interstitial regions. The predictions of Onsager theory are in good agreement with MC simulation data.},

types of biaxial particles differing in their cross sections. The orientation
of the principal particle axis is fixed in space, while the second axis is
allowed to freely rotate. We have constructed a free-energy density functional
based on fundamental--measure theory to study the relative stability of nematic
and smectic phases with uniaxial, biaxial and tetratic symmetries. Minimization
of the density functional allows us to study the phase behavior of the biaxial
particles as a function of the cross-section geometry. For low values of the
aspect ratio of the particle cross section, we obtain smectic phases with
tetratic symmetry, although metastable with respect to the crystal, as our MC
simulation study indicates. For large particle aspect ratios and in analogy
with previous work [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 5, 3700 (2003)], we have found a
four--phase point where four spinodals, corresponding to phase transitions
between phases with different symmetries, meet together. The location of this
point is quite sensitive to particle cross section, which suggests that
optimizing the particle geometry could be a useful criterion in the design of
colloidal particles that can exhibit an increased stability of the biaxial
nematic phase with respect to other competing phases with spatial order.},

We predict that, depending on the relative lengths of the rods these particles can form a uniaxial nematic phase, and more surprisingly they can exhibit a cubatic phase, a special case of the biaxial nematic phase. These predictions may be experimentally testable, as experimental realizations of tetrapods have recently become available.},

The standard time delayed mutual information fails to distinguish information that is actually exchanged from shared information due to common history and input signals.

@article{Savage2006,
abstract = {We studied the kinetics of sublimating crystals with single-particle resolution by experiments with colloidal spheres and by computer simulations. A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals.},

@article{Hansen2003a,
abstract = {Evolvability is the ability to respond to a selective challenge. This requires the capacity to produce the right kind of variation for selection to act upon. To understand evolvability we therefore need to understand the variational properties of biological organisms. Modularity is a variational property, which has been linked to evolvability. If different characters are able to vary independently, selection will be able to optimize each character separately without interference. But although modularity seems like a good design principle for an evolvable organism, it does not therefore follow that it is the only design that can achieve evolvability. In this essay I analyze the effects of modularity and, more generally, pleiotropy on evolvability. Although, pleiotropy causes interference between the adaptation of different characters, it also increases the variational potential of those characters. The most evolvable genetic architectures may often be those with an intermediate level of integration among characters, and in particular those where pleiotropic effects are variable and able to compensate for each other's constraints.},

abstract = {This paper serves as an introductory review of Brownian Dynamics (BD), Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo (MC) modeling techniques. These three simulation methods have proven to be exceptional investigative solutions for probing discrete molecular, ionic, and colloidal motions at their basic microscopic levels. The review offers a general study of the classical theories and algorithms that are foundational to Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. Important topics of interest include fundamental theories that govern Brownian motion, the Langevin equation, the Verlet algorithm, and the Metropolis method. Brownian Dynamics demonstrates advantages over Molecular Dynamics as pertaining to the issue of time-scale separation. Monte Carlo methods exhibit strengths in terms of ease of implementation. Hybrid techniques that combine these methods and draw from these efficacies are also presented. With their rigorous microscopic approach, Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods prove to be especially viable modeling methods for problems with challenging complexities such as high-level particle concentration and multiple particle interactions. These methods hold promising potential for effective modeling of transport in colloidal systems.},

abstract = {In this work a replica exchange Monte Carlo scheme which considers an extended isobaric-isothermal ensemble with respect to pressure is applied to study hard spheres (HSs). The idea behind the proposal is expanding volume instead of increasing temperature to let crowded systems characterized by dominant repulsive interactions to unblock, and so, to produce sampling from disjoint configurations. The method produces, in a single parallel run, the complete HS equation of state. Thus, the first order fluid-solid transition is captured. The obtained results well agree with previous calculations. This approach seems particularly useful to treat purely entropy-driven systems such as hard body and nonadditive hard mixtures, where temperature plays a trivial role.},

Here we present experimental measurements of the structures and free energies of colloidal clusters in which the particles act as hard spheres with short-range attractions. We found that highly symmetric clusters are strongly suppressed by rotational entropy, whereas the most stable clusters have anharmonic vibrational modes or extra bonds. Many of these clusters are subsets of close-packed lattices. As the number of particles increases from 6 to 10, we observe the emergence of a complex free-energy landscape with a small number of ground states and many local minima.},

For polymer coils with a diameter sigma(P) larger than 0.3sigma(D), where sigma(D) is the diameter of the platelets, isotropic fluid-fluid coexistence is observed, in addition to the usual isotropic-nematic transition for hard disk systems. For very small polymer coils (sigma(P)<0.1sigma(D)), a nematic-nematic demixing transition is observed, although this occurs at extremely high platelet density. The case of colloidal platelets and thin stiff rods is also examined. Demixing is observed in the isotropic phase for long rods and in the nematic phase for short rods, as for large and small polymer coils, respectively. However, the nematic-nematic demixing transition for platelet-rod mixtures occurs at a much lower platelet density than in the platelet-disk mixtures.},

abstract = {The impact of particle geometry on the phase behavior of hard colloidal tetragonal parallelepipeds (TPs) was studied by using Monte Carlo simulations in continuum space. TPs or "cuboids" of aspect ratios varying from 0.25 to 8 were simulated by approximating their shapes with multisite objects, i.e., via rigid clusters of hard spheres. Using equation of state curves, order parameters, radial distribution functions, particle distribution functions along three directions, and visual analysis of configurations, an approximate phase diagram for the TPs was mapped out as a function of aspect ratio (r) and volume fraction. For r > 3 and intermediate concentrations, the behavior of the TPs was similar to that of spherocylinders, exhibiting similar liquid crystalline mesophases (e.g., nematic and smectic phases). For r = 1, a cubatic phase occurs with orientational order along the three axes but with little translational order. For 1 < r < 4, the TPs exhibit a cubatic-like mesophase with a high degree of order along three axes where the major axes of the particles are not all aligned in the same direction. For r < 1, the TPs exhibit a smectic-like phase where the particles have rotational freedom in each layer but form stacks with tetratic order. The equation of state for perfect hard cubes (r = 1) was also simulated and found to be consistent with that of the rounded-edge r = 1 TPs, except for its lack of discontinuity at the cubatic-solid transition.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient algorithm to sample the volume in Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The method is designed to be applied in the simulation of hard-core models at high density. The algorithm is based in the generation of clusters of particles. At the volume change step, the distances between pairs of particles belonging to the same cluster do not change. This is done by rescaling the positions of the center of mass of each cluster instead of the position of each individual particle. We have tested the performance of the algorithm by simulating fluid and solid phases of hard spheres, finding that in both cases the algorithm is much more efficient than the standard procedure. Moreover, the efficiency of the method measured in terms of correlation "time" does not depend on the system size in contrast with the standard method, in which the sampling becomes rapidly inefficient as the system size increases. We have used the procedure to compute with high precision the equation of state of the face-centered-cubic phase of the hard sphere system for different system sizes. Using these results we have estimated the equation of state at the thermodynamic limit. The results are compared to different equations of state proposed in literature.},

abstract = {The irradiation of metals by energetic particles causes significant degradation of the mechanical properties, most notably an increased yield stress and decreased ductility, often accompanied by plastic flow localization. Such effects limit the lifetime of pressure vessels in nuclear power plants, and constrain the choice of materials for fusion-based alternative energy sources. Although these phenomena have been known for many years, the underlying fundamental mechanisms and their relation to the irradiation field have not been clearly demonstrated. Here we use three-dimensional multiscale simulations of irradiated metals to reveal the mechanisms underlying plastic flow localization in defect-free channels. We observe dislocation pinning by irradiation-induced clusters of defects, subsequent unpinning as defects are absorbed by the dislocations, and cross-slip of the latter as the stress is increased. The width of the plastic flow channels is limited by the interaction among opposing dislocation dipole segments and the remaining defect clusters.},

abstract = {By means of computer simulations, we study how droplets of hard, rodlike particles optimize their shape and internal structure under the influence of the osmotic compression caused by the presence of spherical particles that act as depletion agents. At sufficiently high osmotic pressures, the rods that make up the drops spontaneously align to turn them into uniaxial nematic liquid-crystalline droplets. The nematic droplets or "tactoids" that are formed this way are not spherical but elongated, resulting from the competition between the anisotropic surface tension and the elastic deformation of the director field. In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, we find that sufficiently small tactoids have a uniform director field, while large ones are characterized by a bipolar director field. From the shape and director-field transformation of the droplets, we are able to estimate the surface anchoring strength and an average of the elastic constants of the hard-rod nematic.},

No differences due to gender of the alcoholic parent were found, and there was no group by gender interaction.

abstract = {By using optical tweezers, we have investigated the mechanical unfolding of a minimal kissing complex with only two G.C base pairs. The loop-loop interaction is exceptionally stable; it is disrupted at forces ranging from 7 to 30 pN, as compared with 14-20 pN for unfolding hairpins of 7 and 11 bp. By monitoring unfolding/folding trajectories of single molecules, we resolved the intermediates, measured their rate constants, and pinpointed the rate-limiting steps. The two hairpins unfold only after breaking the intramolecular kissing interaction, and the kissing interaction forms only after the folding of the hairpins. At forces that favor the unfolding of the hairpins, the entire RNA structure is kinetically stabilized by the kissing interaction, and extra work is required to unfold the metastable hairpins. The strong mechanical stability of even a minimal kissing complex indicates the importance of such loop-loop interactions in initiating and stabilizing RNA dimers in retroviruses.},

abstract = {We use grand canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo and discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls. These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that "in-phase" oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size. These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.},

abstract = {Bacteria can secrete a wide array of antibacterial compounds when competing with other bacteria for the same resources. Some of these compounds, such as bacteriocins, can affect bacteria of similar or closely related strains. In some cases, these secretions have been found to kill sibling cells that belong to the same colony. Here, we present experimental observations of competition between 2 sibling colonies of Paenibacillus dendritiformis grown on a low-nutrient agar gel. We find that neighboring colonies (growing from droplet inoculation) mutually inhibit growth through secretions that become lethal if the level exceeds a well-defined threshold. In contrast, within a single colony developing from a droplet inoculation, no growth inhibition is observed. However, growth inhibition and cell death are observed if material extracted from the agar between 2 growing colonies is introduced outside a growing single colony. To interpret the observations, we devised a simple mathematical model for the secretion of an antibacterial compound. Simulations of this model illustrate how secretions from neighboring colonies can be deadly, whereas secretions from a single colony growing from a droplet are not.},

abstract = {We use discontinuous molecular dynamics and grand-canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulations to explore how confinement between parallel hard walls modifies the relationships between packing fraction, self-diffusivity, partial molar excess entropy, and total excess entropy for binary hard-sphere mixtures. To accomplish this, we introduce an efficient algorithm to calculate partial molar excess entropies from the transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulation data. We find that the species-dependent self-diffusivities of confined fluids are very similar to those of the bulk mixture if compared at the same, appropriately defined, packing fraction up to intermediate values, but then deviate negatively from the bulk behavior at higher packing fractions. On the other hand, the relationships between self-diffusivity and partial molar excess entropy (or total excess entropy) observed in the bulk fluid are preserved under confinement even at relatively high packing fractions and for different mixture compositions. This suggests that the excess entropy, calculable from classical density functional theories of inhomogeneous fluids, can be used to predict some of the nontrivial dynamical behaviors of fluid mixtures in confined environments.},

abstract = {We use grand canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo and discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls. These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that "in-phase" oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size. These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers.},

abstract = {Many thermodynamic and dynamic properties of water display unusual behavior at low enough temperatures. In a recent study, Yan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 130604 (2005)] identified a spherically symmetric two-scale potential that displays many of the same anomalous properties as water. More specifically, for select parametrizations of the potential, one finds that the regions where isothermal compression anomalously (i) decreases the fluid's structural order, (ii) increases its translational self-diffusivity, and (iii) increases its entropy form nested domes in the temperature-density plane. These property relationships are similar to those found for more realistic models of water. In this work, the authors provide evidence that suggests that the anomalous regions specified above can all be linked through knowledge of the excess entropy. Specifically, the authors show how entropy scaling relationships developed by Rosenfeld [Phys. Rev. A 15, 2545 (1977)] can be used to describe the region of diffusivity anomalies and to predict the state conditions for which anomalous viscosity and thermal conductivity behavior might be found.},

abstract = {This paper examines the prospects for quantifying disorder in simple molecular or colloidal systems. As a central element in this task, scalar measures for describing both translational and bond-orientational order are introduced. These measures are subsequently used to characterize the structures that result from a series of molecular-dynamics simulations of the hard-sphere system. The simulation results can be illustrated by a two-parameter ordering phase diagram, which indicates the relative placement of the equilibrium phases in order-parameter space. Moreover, the diagram serves as a useful tool for understanding the effect of history on disorder in nonequilibrium structures. Our investigation provides fresh insights into the types of ordering that can occur in equilibrium and glassy systems, including quantitative evidence that, at least in the case of hard spheres, contradicts the notion that glasses are simply solids with the "frozen in" structure of an equilibrium liquid. Furthermore, examination of the order exhibited by the glassy structures suggests, to our knowledge, a new perspective on the old problem of random close packing.},

@article{Pond2009,
abstract = {We report molecular dynamics simulation results for two-component fluid mixtures of Gaussian-core particles, focusing on how tracer diffusivities and static pair correlations depend on temperature, particle concentration, and composition. At low particle concentrations, these systems behave like simple atomic mixtures. However, for intermediate concentrations, the single-particle dynamics of the two species largely decouple, giving rise to the following anomalous trends. Increasing either the concentration of the fluid (at fixed composition) or the mole fraction of the larger particles (at fixed particle concentration) enhances the tracer diffusivity of the larger particles but decreases that of the smaller particles. In fact, at sufficiently high particle concentrations, the larger particles exhibit higher mobility than the smaller particles. Each of these dynamic behaviors is accompanied by a corresponding structural trend that characterizes how either concentration or composition affects the strength of the static pair correlations. Specifically, the dynamic trends observed here are consistent with a single empirical scaling law that relates an appropriately normalized tracer diffusivity to its pair-correlation contribution to the excess entropy.},

How do these systems differ from thermal equilibrium systems with such liquid crystalline order? Working with a fluidized monolayer of macroscopic rods in the nematic liquid crystalline phase, we find giant number fluctuations consistent with a standard deviation growing linearly with the mean, in contrast to any situation where the central limit theorem applies. These fluctuations are long-lived, decaying only as a logarithmic function of time. This shows that flocking, coherent motion, and large-scale inhomogeneity can appear in a system in which particles do not communicate except by contact.},

A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals.},

Analytical results are obtained for the transition densities of the isotropic-nematic and the nematic-smectic phase transitions. It is shown that the stability of the nematic and smectic phases is very sensitive to the molecular shape. In the hard needle limit, only the isotropic-nematic phase transition takes place, while increasing the tail length and the bent angle between the central core and the tails destabilizes the nematic phase. On the other hand the stability of the smectic phase is due to the increasing excluded area cost with bent angle and the tail length. The zigzag particles pack in a layered structure such that they are tilted and form semi-ideal gas in the layers to push the high cost excluded area regions into the interstitial regions. The predictions of Onsager theory are in good agreement with MC simulation data.},

Few are reported to do the opposite, that is, shear thicken, despite the longstanding expectation that shear thickening is a generic type of suspension behaviour. Here we resolve this apparent contradiction. We demonstrate that shear thickening can be masked by a yield stress and can be recovered when the yield stress is decreased below a threshold. We show the generality of this argument and quantify the threshold in rheology experiments where we control yield stresses arising from a variety of sources, such as attractions from particle surface interactions, induced dipoles from applied electric and magnetic fields, as well as confinement of hard particles at high packing fractions. These findings open up possibilities for the design of smart suspensions that combine shear thickening with electro- or magnetorheological response.},

@article{DePitta2009,
abstract = {Many cells use calcium signaling to carry information from the extracellular side of the plasma membrane to targets in their interior. Since virtually all cells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca(2+) signaling, much effort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca(2+) responses and to decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network of Ca(2+)-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show that Ca(2+) signals in response to external stimuli encode information via frequency modulation (FM) or alternatively via amplitude modulation (AM). Although minimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to exhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation theory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex modes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We consider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding can occur by AM of Ca(2+) oscillations, by FM or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium signaling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is nowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal activity and information processing of the brain. We explain that our results can be crucial for a better understanding of synaptic information transfer. Furthermore, our results might also be important for better insight on other examples of physiological processes regulated by Ca(2+) signaling.},

@article{Rappel2008,
abstract = {Chemotactic eukaryotic cells are able to detect chemoattractant gradients that are both shallow and have a low background concentration. Under these conditions, the noise in the number of bound receptors can be significant and needs to be taken into account in determining the directional sensing process. Here, we quantify numerically the number of bound receptors on the membrane of a disk-shaped cell by using a numerical Monte Carlo tool. The obtained time traces of the receptor occupancy can be used as inputs for any directional sensing model. We investigate the response of the local excitation global inhibition model and a recently developed balanced inactivation model. We determine a measure for the motility of the cell for each model, based on the relevant output variable, as a function of experimental parameters, resulting in several experimentally testable predictions. Furthermore, we show that these two models behave in a qualitatively different fashion when the background concentration is varied. Thus, to properly characterize the sensitivity of cells to receptor occupancy, it is not sufficient to examine the input signal. Rather, one needs to take into account the response of the second messenger pathway.},

abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},
